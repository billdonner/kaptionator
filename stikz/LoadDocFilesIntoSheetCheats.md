##The Sheets

The Gig Matrix is a matrix of song titles accessible via a single finger tap while performing onstage. Each touchpoint in the matrix takes the performer to the collection of song documents associated with the song title.

##Loading and Unloading Document Files into Sheet Cheats

The matrix is loaded from externally produced CSV files.  Parts of the matrix can be selectively removed from within the “Sections Editor” feature of the app.

###File Types Supported

CSV files can be exported from simple Excel or Numbers spreadsheets or produced directly in your text editor. 

###Load from Camera Roll or Camera

###Load from iTunes

You can load CSV files thru iTunes File Sharing in the standard fashion. Connect your SheetCheats device to your computer, run iTunes, select your device, go to the Apps Page, go all the way to right hand side and scroll all the way down. 

Now look for the SheetCheats icon and select the app. Drag the files from your computer into iTunes and when all done, go hit the Import from iTunes function in the app.

###Unloading

In the course of normal use you will often revise your sets or gigs and make new CSV files. Sheet Cheats is indiscriminate and will gladly add duplicate information to the GigMatrix.

If you have parts of the Gig Matrix you’d like to eliminate you can use the Section Editing functions available from the Settings page.
